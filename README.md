# Exercise Tracker app

> The Exercise Tracker app project by freeCodeCamp is a full-stack JavaScript application that allows users to track their workouts. 

> It is a good project for beginners to practice building full-stack applications, as it covers a variety of topics, including:

> Front-end development with React.js (Under Development)

> Back-end development with Node.js and Express.js

> Database storage with MongoDB (Disabled)

> Authentication with Passport.js (Under Development)

## To build your own Exercise Tracker app, you will need to:

> Create a new React.js project.

> Install the necessary dependencies, including Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Passport.js.

> Create a new Node.js project for the backend API.

> Set up the database and authentication system.

> Create the necessary routes in the backend API to handle user and exercise requests.

> Develop the React.js front-end to allow users to create, view, and edit their workouts.

> Connect the front-end to the backend API.

> Once you have implemented the Exercise Tracker app, you can test it by creating a new user account and logging in. You should then be able to create, view, and edit your workouts.

> The Exercise Tracker app project is a good way to practice building full-stack applications and learn about a variety of JavaScript technologies. It is also a useful tool to help you track your own workouts and stay motivated.

## Here are some additional features (under development) for adding to Exercise Tracker app:

> The ability to create and share custom workout plans.

> The ability to set goals and track your progress.

> The ability to integrate with other fitness apps, such as Google Fit or Strava.

> The ability to generate reports on your workouts and progress.

> The Exercise Tracker app project is a good starting point for building a more complex fitness tracking application.
